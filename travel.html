            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and
                provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone contains
                about half the world's active geysers.</p>
            <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists. Every year visitors
                injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals. You can see examples of people making
                bad decisions by visiting <a

            <p>Banff National Park is in Western Canada in the province of Alberta. It is near the city of Calgary and
                situated in the Rocky Mountains. Banff is known for its mountains and natural beauty, along with its
                plant and animal life. The national park fuels the tourist industry in Western Canada.
                Banff has many attractions within its borders including numerous lakes fed by glaciers creating an
                iconic turquoise color. Banff also borders numerous other national parks further boosting its
                attractiveness as a tourist location. Banff’s glaciers have been shrinking and may disappear in the next
                few decades.

            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>

            <p>The Grand Canyon is a natural geological formation located in the state of Arizona. It is a steep-sided
                canyon carved by the Colorado River over millions of years. The canyon is known for its size, vibrant
                and varied colors, and intricate rock formations. It is one of the most famous and visited natural
                landmarks in the United States and around the world.
                Though the Grand Canyon is one of the most iconic places to travel, there are many dangers that come
                from such a terrain. Between 2010 and 2020, 134 have died, mainly due to extreme heat. You can see
                below, examples of people getting hurt due to the heat and carelessness.
